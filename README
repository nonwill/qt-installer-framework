The Qt Installer Framework provides a set of tools and utilities to create
installers for the supported desktop Qt platforms: Linux, Microsoft Windows, and
Mac OS X.


Documentation
--------------------------

The binary packages for the Qt Installer Framework include documentation in the
doc directory. See http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt-Installer-Framework for a link
to online versions.

Notes
--------------------------
- To build an installer, it is advised to use a statically linked Qt. See the
  documentation at
  http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtifw-master/ifw-getting-started.html
- At the moment, building with Qt 4.8.x and Qt 5.2.x is supported.
- Qt IFW 2.0 and on will only support building with Qt 5.
