    \title Operations

    The operations are prepared by component scripts and performed by the
    installer.
    \note Operations are performed threaded.

    Internally, each operation has a \e DO step that contains instructions for
    the installer and an \e UNDO step that contains instructions for the
    uninstaller.

    \section1 Summary of Operations

    The following table summarizes the available operations and their syntax.

    \table
        \header
            \o  Operation
            \o  Syntax
            \o  Use
        \row
            \o  Copy
            \o  "Copy" \a source \a target
            \o  Copies a file from \a source to \a target.
        \row
            \o  Move
            \o  "Move" \a source \a target
            \o  Moves a file from \a source to \a target.
        \row
            \o  Delete
            \o  "Delete" \a filename
            \o  Deletes the file specified by \a filename.
        \row
            \o  Mkdir
            \o  "Mkdir" \a path
            \o  Creates the directory path \a path.
        \row
            \o  Rmdir
            \o  "Rmdir" \a path
            \o  Removes the directory path \a path.
        \row
            \o  AppendFile
            \o  "AppendFile" \a filename \a text
            \o  Appends \a text to the file specified by \a filename. \a text is
                treated as ASCII text.
        \row
            \o  PrependFile
            \o  "PrependFile" \a filename \a text
            \o  Prepends \a text to the file specified by \a filename. \a text
                is treated as ASCII text.
        \row
            \o  Replace
            \o  "Replace" \a file \a search \ replace
            \o  Opens \a file to find \a search string and replaces that with the \a replace string.
        \row
            \o  LineReplace
            \o  "LineReplace" \a file \a search \ replace
            \o  Opens \a file to find lines that start with \a search string and
                replaces that with the \a replace string.
        \row
            \o  Execute
            \o  "Execute" [{\a exitcodes}] \a command [\a parameter1 [\a parameter... [\a parameter10]]]
            \o  Executes the command specified by \a command. Up to 10
                parameters can be passed. If that is not enough, you can use a JavaScript string array.

                Optionally, you can pass a comma-separated list of exit codes
                within curly brackets ({}) as the first argument to specify the
                exit codes for successful execution. This defaults to "{0}".

                Other optional named arguments are: "workingdirectory=<your_working_dir>";
                "errormessage=<your_custom_errormessage>"

                In addition, a special argument, UNDOEXECUTE, separates the DO step of the operation
                from the UNDO step.

                example:
                \code
                component.addOperation("Execute", "touch", "test.txt", "UNDOEXECUTE", "rm", "test.txt")
                \endcode
        \row
            \o  CreateShortcut
            \o  "CreateShortcut" \a filename \a linkname [\a arguments]
            \o  Creates a shortcut from the file specified by \a filename to
                \a linkname.
                On Windows, this creates a .lnk file which can have
                \a arguments. On Unix, this creates a symbolic link.
        \row
            \o  CreateDesktopEntry
            \o  "CreateDesktopEntry" \a filename \a "key=value[\nkey2=value2[\nkey3=value3]]]"
            \o  Creates a .desktop initialization file, as specified by
                freedesktop.org.

                If \a filename is absolute, the desktop entry is stored there.
                Otherwise, it is stored in the location specified in
                \c{$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications} or
                \c{$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications}, including the default paths for
                both, as defined by freedesktop.org.

                The key-value pairs are written to the file.

                The file is set to use UTF-8 encoding.
        \row
            \o  InstallIcons
            \o  "InstallIcons" \a directory \a [Vendorprefix]
            \o  Installs the contents of \a directory into a location, as
                specified by freedesktop.org. That is, into
                \c {$XDG_DATA_DIRS/icons}, \c {/usr/share/icons}, or
                \c {$HOME/.icons}. The files are removed from their initial
                location. Make sure to add this operation after the operation
                that extracts the files from the archive.
                If you provide a \a Vendorprefix it replaces all characters up to the
                first dash (-) in the filename of the icon with this prefix.
        \row
            \o  Extract
            \o  "Extract" \a archive \a targetdirectory
            \o  Extracts \a archive to \a targetdirectory.

        \row
            \o  GlobalConfig
            \o  "GlobalConfig" \a company \a application \a key \a value

                or

                "GlobalConfig" \a filename \a key \a value
            \o  Stores \a value for \a key in a configuration file. The
                configuration file is specified either by \a filename
                (using \a QSettings::NativeFormat, which might be the Windows
                registry) or by \a application and \a company name.
        \row
            \o  EnvironmentVariable
            \o  "EnvironmentVariable" \a key \a value [[\a persistent] \a system]
            \o  Sets the environment variable \a key to \a value. If
                \a persistent is set to \c true, the variable is set
                persistently. This is currently only supported on Windows.
                If \a system is set to \c true, the persistent variable is set
                system-wide, not only for the current user.
        \row
            \o  RegisterFileType
            \o  "RegisterFileType" \a extension \a command [\a description [\a contentType [\a icon]]].
            \o  Registers the file type with \a extension to be opened via
                \a command. Optionally, you can specify \a description,
                \a contentType, and \a icon. This is currently only supported on
                Windows.
    \endtable

    If errors occur, you can test operations manually on the uninstaller or
    installer. However, variables are not resolved, so you need to use absolute
    values.

    For example, to test copying a file:
    \code
    Installer --runoperation "Copy" "<source>" "<target>"
    \endcode
